</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(254, 254, 254);"> FIRST is a robotics-based organization with a 
    goal to spread STEM across the world. I joined the first program in 5rd grade in FIRST Lego League, as a programmer 
    on team 39708 STARS participating in the Replay and Cargo Connect season, and later trasitioned to 55989 LEDS as the captain 
for the duration of the Superpowered season. My passion continued onto FIRST Tech Challenge which I participate on currently as programmer
originally as the captian of 24163 Illuminate for Centerstage and Into The Deep. Now I am a programmer on 13100 47 Beavers for the Decode season.
I hope to continue FTC as it has been engraved in my life for well...almost 6 years. </h3>
